-- It is more readable to write SQL statments in uppercase letters
-- It is better to avoid using * because it selects all the data, which may not be nessasery
-- It also makes your database server work harder and increase the traffic between the database server and
-- applications. As the result, it slows down your app.
-- Therefore, you should specify the column names in the SELECT clause whenever possible to get only necessary data from a table

-- the SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

--  If you want to query just particular rows from a table the WHERE statement comes in handy
-- The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
-- Logical operators in SQL: 
-- = Equal
-- > Greater than
--  < less than
--  >= Greater than or equal
--  <= Less than or equal
--  != Not equal
-- AND
-- OR
